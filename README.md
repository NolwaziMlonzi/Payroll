I am particularly proud of being able to develop such a challlenging application and being able to accomplish it with
the use of the knowledge that i have acquired from my studies.
Not only did i use that knowledge but i also did some research which boosted my knowledge about the system and what is required of me.
I believe that the more i do application, i become a better developer.
